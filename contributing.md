To make it simpiler and quicker to contribute to Bonge, here are the guidelines in which all contributions must follow.

# General

All user created content is not constantly monitored. We ask that all user created content for the Bonge project uses English (Even if it is translated using any means) with no offencive language. 
While we can not monitor all content, the Bonge team will take action against bad actors.

Before submitting any user created content, we ask you do a quick search just to make sure there isn't already something like your content. 
This removes duplicates saving both your time and our time. 
If your content is expecting a response however is a duplicate then your response will be the link to the duplication and actions maybe taken to remove others from seeing your content.


# Plugin compatibility

Please submit your plugin compatibility on the Google Sheet's form that is linked in the readme file. 
If you have a crash with the plugin then please make a issue on our issue tab (above). 
Please note that some errors will not ever be fixed due to the plugin in question running code that will never be in Bonge. 

An example of this is NMS or Craftbukkit, these crashes normally give the message of "Can not cast X to Y" where Y starts with org.craftbukkit or net.minecraft.
